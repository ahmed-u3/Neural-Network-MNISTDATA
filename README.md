# Neural-Network-MNISTDATA
The aim of this project is to design and implement a Fully-Connected Neural Network (FCNN) model that can effectively train and validate the MNIST dataset. 
The FCNN will consist of multiple layers of densely connected neurons, which will be optimized using a suitable optimization algorithm such as SGD or Adam. 
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits, which will be used to train the model to accurately classify new images of digits. 
The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.
